                            I found early on in my technology career that to build great relationships with our customers, we had to do the little things right.
                            When working in desktop support, this meant going the extra mile for them. If you replace their computer, you put their files back where they were before.
                            When you setup a new computer, you made sure to cable manage their desk for them.
                            As a Systems Specialist, doing the little things right means being good stewards of the University of Wyoming's data.
                            This quote from Admiral McRaven is an ever standing reminder that every task we do for our customers is a chance to reinforce that our organization
                            is there to help them, not get in the way of progress towards their or the universities mission.

                    <p>
                        My name is André Fecteau. I am currently a System Specialist leading the Business Intelligence team here at UW in Laramie, Wyoming.
                        I started out in desktop support at the University of Connecticut, where I also earned my Individualized Bachelors of Arts in Information Systems Operations.
                        I worked up from a student worker to full-time staff before moving to Laramie to become a System Administrator in July of 2019.
                        In Summer of 2021 I embarked on a journey to get my Masters of Science in Organizational Leadership from Trine University;
                        Which I finished 1 year later in May of 2022.
